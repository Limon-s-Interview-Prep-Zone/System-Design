    "1. **Generalization**: Represents a \"is-a\" relationship between a parent (general) and child (specific) class.\n",
    "   - When you have multiple classes that share common attributes or methods.\n",
    "   - To promote reusability and reduce redundancy.\n",
    "2. **Inheritance**: A specific case of generalization where a child class inherits all the fields and methods of the parent class but can override or extend them.\n",
    "   - When you want to extend the functionality of an existing class.\n",
    "   - To create a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "3. **Use Interface**:\n",
    "   - When you want to define a set of methods that multiple classes must implement.\n",
    "   - To achieve polymorphism, allowing different classes to be treated as the same type\n",
    "4. **Association(`Teacher-1----*-Course`)**: Association represents a relationship between two classes where one class uses or interacts with another.\n",
    "   - To show that objects of one class are connected to objects of another class.\n",
    "   - To model the interactions between different objects\n",
    "5. **Uni-direction Association(`Customer-1----*-<*>Order`)**: Uni-directional association means that one class is aware of the other class, but the reverse is not true.\n",
    "   - When only one class needs to know about the relationship.\n",
    "   - To simplify the design when the relationship is not bidirectional.\n",
    "6. **Aggregation(`Library<>---Book`):** Aggregation is a special form of association that represents a whole-part relationship. The part can exist independently of the whole.\n",
    "   - To represent a whole-part relationship where the part can exist independently.\n",
    "   - To model relationships where the lifecycle of the part is not dependent on the whole.\n",
    "7. **Composition(`House<*>---Room`):** Composition is a stronger form of aggregation where the part cannot exist independently of the whole. If the whole is destroyed, the part is also destroyed.\n",
    "   - Whole: House\n",
    "   - Part: Room\n",
    "   - To represent a whole-part relationship where the part cannot exist independently.\n",
    "   - To model relationships where the lifecycle of the part is tightly coupled with the whole.\n",
