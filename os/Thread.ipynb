    "### Threading Trade-off:\n",
    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "1. **Concurrency**: Multithreading allows multiple tasks (or threads) to run concurrently within a `single process`.\n",
    "2. **Parallelism**: On multicore systems, multithreading enables parallel execution, where multiple threads run simultaneously on **different CPU cores**.\n",
    "3. Responsiveness and Low Latency: Multithreading improves application responsiveness by allowing time-consuming tasks to run in the background, without freezing the user interface (UI). This reduces latency, as threads can process user inputs or system events immediately.\n",
    "4. Efficient Resource Utilization: Multithreading optimizes the use of system resources, especially when a task involves waiting for external input/output (I/O) operations like file reading or network access.\n",
    "5.  Asynchronous Processing: Multithreading enables asynchronous task execution, where certain tasks can run in the background without blocking the main process.\n",
    "6.  Thread Pool: Thread pooling is an important feature of multithreading that allows efficient reuse of threads. Instead of creating and destroying threads repeatedly (which is costly in terms of performance), a pool of pre-created threads is maintained, and tasks are assigned to them as needed.\n",
    "7.  Synchronization: Multithreading provides mechanisms to control access to shared resources through synchronization. This prevents race conditions, where multiple threads try to modify the same data simultaneously, ensuring consistency and correctness in the program.\n"
