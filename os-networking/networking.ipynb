    "1. **`IP address`**: An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a numerical label assigned to devices in a network for identification and communication. It exists in two versions:\n",
    "   - `IPv4` (e.g., 192.168.1.1): A 32-bit address divided into `four octets`.\n",
    "   - `IPv6` (e.g., 2001:db8::ff00:42:8329): A 128-bit address for more extensive networks.\n",
    "   - Use Case:\n",
    "     - Devices use IP addresses to send and receive data over a network or the internet.\n",
    "2. **IP address Space**: IP address space refers to the total range of available IP addresses within a network.\n",
    "   - `IPv4`: 4,294,967,296 addresses (2³²)\n",
    "   - `IPv6`: 2¹²⁸ addresses (practically infinite)\n",
    "3. **Subnet**: A subnet (short for subnetwork) is a logical division of an IP network, defined by a subnet mask `(e.g., 255.255.255.0)`. It determines which part of the IP address represents the network and which part represents the host.\n",
    "   - **IP Address**: 192.168.1.10\n",
    "   - **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.0\n",
    "   - **Subnet size**: 256 addresses (2⁸)\n",
    "   - **Usable hosts**: 254 (2⁸ - 2, since first is the `Network ID`, and last is the `Broadcast ID`)\n",
    "   - Subnetting improves network efficiency by reducing broadcast traffic and segregating networks.\n",
    "4. **Net Id**: The Network ID represents the first address in a subnet, identifying the network itself. All hosts within a subnet share the same Net ID.\n",
    "   - 192.168.1.10/24:\n",
    "     - Binary IP: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010\n",

    "     - Net ID (AND operation): 192.168.1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Broadcast Id**: The Broadcast ID is the last address in a subnet and is used to send messages to all hosts within the subnet.\n",
    "   - Essential for broadcast communications, such as DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).\n",
    "   - For 192.168.1.10/24:\n",
    "   - Binary Broadcast: 11000000.10101000.00000001.11111111\n",
    "   - Broadcast Address: 192.168.1.255\n",
    "6. **Host Id**: The Host ID is the part of the IP address assigned to individual devices within a subnet.\n",
    "   - For `192.168.1.10/24`, the Net ID is `192.168.1.0`, so:\n",
    "   - `Host IDs`: `192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254`\n",
    "   - `Multicast IP`: 192.168.1.255\n",
    "7. **Reserved Adress**: Some IP addresses are reserved for specific purposes:\n",
    "   - Private IPs avoid conflicts on the public internet.\n",
    "   - Loopback(127.0.0.1) is used for self-testing on a machine.\n",
    "   - Multicast allows one-to-many communication.\n",
    "8. **Private IP**: These are used inside a local network (LAN) and not routable on the internet.\n",
    "   - Home networks (Wi-Fi routers assign private IPs)\n",
    "   - Office LANs (Internal communication)\n",
    "   - Virtual Machines and Docker containers\n",
    "   - Example: `PC → 192.168.1.100`\n",
    "9.  **Public IP**: These are assigned by ISPs (Internet Service Providers) and are routable on the internet.\n",
    "    -  Hosting websites `(example.com → 203.0.113.10)`\n",
    "    -  public IP: 203.0.113.10 \n",
    "    -  Router assigns private IPs (192.168.1.x) to home devices\n",
    "    -  The Gateway (Router) translates `private IPs → public IP using NAT` (Network Address Translation)\n",
    "10. **Gateway**: A Gateway IP is the local network’s exit point `(typically router)` to other networks, including the internet.\n",
    "    - Inside the local network (LAN).\n",
    "    - A gateway allows devices within a private network to communicate with external devices.\n",
    "    - `How it works`: When a device on the local network `(e.g., PC with IP 192.168.1.100)` wants to communicate with an external network, it sends data to the gateway IP (router), which then forwards the data to the appropriate destination outside the local network.\n",
