    "# Authentication and Authorization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Authentication:\n",
    "Authentication is the process of varyfying the identity of user or systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Authentication:**\n",
    "1. `Basic Authentication:` Client sends the username and password encoded in Base64 in the HTTP header with every request. The server decodes and validates the credentials.\n",
    "2. `Token-Based Authentication (JWT, OAuth2):` User logs in and receives a token (e.g., JWT). The token is sent with every request as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.\n",
    "3. `Session-Based Authentication:`\n",
    "   1. The server creates a session after the user logs in.\n",
    "   2. A session ID is stored on the server and shared with the client via a cookie.\n",
    "   3. For subsequent requests, the client sends the session cookie.\n",
    "4. `Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):`\n",
    "   1. Requires two or more verification steps, such as:\n",
    "      1. Password (something you know)\n",
    "      2. OTP via SMS (something you have)\n",
    "      3. Biometric data (something you are)\n",
    "5. `Social Authentication (OAuth, OpenID Connect):`\n",
    "   1. Users log in via third-party providers (Google, Facebook, GitHub).\n",
    "   2. The app uses OAuth to authenticate the user by redirecting them to the provider.\n",
    "6. `Biometric Authentication:`\n",
    "   1. Uses fingerprint, facial recognition, or voice authentication.\n",
    "   2. Biometric authentication relies on hardware and software integration.\n",
    "7. `API Key Authentication:`\n",
    "   1. An API key is generated for the client.\n",
    "   2. The key is sent in headers or query parameters for each request.\n",
    "---\n",
    "### JWT\n",
    "A JWT (JSON Web Token) is a `compact, self-contained token` used for securely transmitting information `between parties`. It consists of three parts. Each part is `Base64Url-encoded` and concatenated using `dots (.)`.\n",
    "1. `Header (algorithm and token type):` The header contains metadata about the token, including the `algorithm` used to generate the signature and the `token type`.\n",
    "   1. `alg:` Algorithm used for signing (e.g., `HS256, RS256`).\n",
    "   2. `typ:` Token type (usually \"JWT\")\n",
    "2. `Payload (claims/data)`: The payload contains the claims, which are statements about an entity (like the user) and additional metadata.\n",
    "   1. `Registered claims:` Standardized fields (e.g., iss, exp, sub).\n",
    "   2. `Public claims:` Custom claims defined by your application (e.g., role, userId).\n",
    "   3. `Private claims:` Shared information between issuer and consumer.\n",
    "3. `Signature (verification):` The signature is used to verify that the message wasn’t tampered with.\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### **Trade-off:**\n",
    "**Pros of JWT**\n",
    "1. **Stateless Authentication:** No need to store session data on the server.\n",
    "2. **Scalability:** Works well with distributed systems or microservices.\n",
    "3. **Compact & Portable:** Can be easily transmitted in HTTP headers.\n",
    "4. **Self-contained:** Carries all the necessary information within the token.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons of JWT**\n",
    "1. **No Server-Side Revocation:** Once a JWT is issued, it can’t be revoked unless there’s a `blacklist mechanism`.\n",
    "2. **Payload Size:** Large payloads increase the size of each request.\n",
    "3. **Security Risk:** If the token is compromised, the attacker has access until it expires.\n",
    "   \n",
    "---\n",
    "#### How JWT works?\n",
    "1. `Login / Authentication Request:` The user sends their credentials (e.g., email and password) to the authentication server via a login endpoint.\n",
    "2. `Verification and Token Generation:`\n",
    "   1. The `server validates the credentials` (by checking against a database).\n",
    "   2. If valid, it generates a `JWT token` containing user data (e.g., user_id, roles) and signs it with a `secret or private key`.\n",
    "3. `Token Sent to Client:`The JWT is returned to the user in the response, usually in a `JSON response.`\n",
    "4. `Client Stores the Token:` The client stores the JWT in a local storage, session storage, or cookie.\n",
    "5. `Accessing Protected Resources:` For every request to a protected resource, the client sends the JWT token in the Authorization header.\n",
    "6. `Token Validation on Server:` The server extracts and verifies the JWT from the request header.\n",
    "   1. If the token is valid (signature matches, and it hasn’t expired), the request is allowed to proceed.\n",
    "   2. If invalid or expired, the server returns a 401 Unauthorized error.\n",
    "7. `Response:` If authenticated, the server sends the requested data to the client\n",

    "# [Oauth2:](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749)\n",
    "OAuth 2.0, which stands for `“Open Authorization”`, is a standard designed to allow a website or application to access resources hosted by other web apps on behalf of a user.\n",
    "- OAuth 2.0 is an `authorization protocol` and NOT an `authentication protocol`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do we need oauth2?\n",
    "Many websites allow users to log in using their `Google or Facebook accounts`. This uses the OAuth2 framework, where the user grants the site permission to access specific information from their social profile (like name, email) without giving away their `Google/Facebook password`. Using `oauth2` the `website (client)` redirects the user to `Google/Facebook (authorization server)`, which asks the user to confirm access. If approved, an access token is issued to the website, allowing limited access to the user’s profile data. However, without `oauth2` the website would need the `user’s Google or Facebook credentials`, creating `security risks`, as this approach could expose the user's password and make the website liable for handling it securely.\n",

    "1. `(A) Authorization Request:` Trello sends Sarah (the Resource Owner) a request to connect with her Google Calendar. Sarah is redirected to Google’s authorization page.\n",
    "2. `(B) Authorization Grant:` Sarah approves the request, granting Trello permission to access her calendar data. This approval sends an Authorization Grant back to Trello.\n",
    "3. (C) `Authorization Grant to Authorization Server:` Trello sends the Authorization Grant to Google’s Authorization Server and requests an access token.\n",
    "4. `(D) Access Token:` Google’s Authorization Server validates the grant and issues an Access Token to Trello.\n",
    "5. `(E) Access Token to Resource Server:` Trello uses the Access Token to make an authorized request to the Google Calendar API (the Resource Server), requesting access to Sarah’s calendar events.\n",
    "6. `(F) Protected Resource:` Google Calendar API (the Resource Server) verifies the Access Token and, if valid, serves the requested calendar data back to Trello.\n",

    "## Authorization Grant\n",
    "In OAuth2, the Authorization Grant is a credential representing the resource owner’s consent for the client to access resources on their behalf. OAuth2 defines four primary types of authorization grants, each suited for different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Authorization Grant Code\n",
    "The authorization code is obtained by using an authorization server as an intermediary between the client and resource owner.  Instead of requesting authorization directly from the resource owner, the client directs the resource owner to an authorization server (IdentityServer), which in turn directs the resource owner back to the client with the authorization code.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Implicit Grant\n",
    "In the implicit flow, instead of issuing the client an authorization code, the client is issued an access token directly (as the result of the resource owner authorization).  The grant type is implicit, as no intermediate credentials (such as an authorization code) are issued (and later used to obtain an access token). For example- Sarah logs into a weather app that needs access to her Google Calendar events. When she grants permission, Google directly provides the access token to the app (which runs entirely in the browser).\n",

    "Access tokens are credentials used to access protected resources.  An access token is a string representing an authorization issued to the client.  The string is usually opaque to the client.  Tokens represent specific scopes and durations of access, granted by the resource owner, and enforced by the resource server and authorization server.\n",

    "1. Use HTTP-only cookies when security is a priority, as they prevent XSS-based token theft. They are especially suitable for applications with a backend server and support CSRF token-based protection(set `samesite=strict`).\n",
    "2. Consider Local Storage only if your application is a pure SPA, and you’re implementing strict security practices to prevent XSS attacks. It’s suitable if you need the token to persist across sessions.\n",

    "2. When a user visits the page, the injected script runs in their browser.\n",

    "**`Prevention:`**\n",
    "1. Input Validation and Output Encoding: Validate and sanitize all user input, and encode output to prevent scripts from being executed.\n",
    "2. Content Security Policy (CSP): Use CSP to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded, blocking inline scripts.\n",
    "3. Use HTTP-only Cookies: Store sensitive cookies (e.g., session tokens) as HTTP-only to prevent JavaScript from accessing them.\n",

    "#### CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):\n",
    "CSRF is an attack that tricks a user into performing an unwanted action on a web application where they are authenticated. By exploiting the fact that browsers automatically include cookies with each request, an attacker can craft a malicious link or form that makes requests to another site on behalf of the user without their consent.\n",
    "\n",
    "***How It Works:***\n",
    "1. The user is logged into a website (e.g., bank.com) and has a valid session cookie.\n",
    "2. The user visits a malicious site while logged in to bank.com.\n",
    "3. The malicious site includes a request (such as a form submission or image load) that targets bank.com and performs an action like transferring funds.\n",
    "4. The browser sends the request to bank.com, along with the user’s session cookie, causing the server to treat the request as if it came from the authenticated user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Prevention:`**\n",
    "1. CSRF Tokens: Include unique, unpredictable tokens in forms and requests. The server checks the token’s validity before processing any sensitive action.\n",
    "2. SameSite Cookies: Use the SameSite attribute for cookies, which instructs the browser not to send cookies on cross-origin requests, preventing CSRF attacks.\n",
    "3. Check Referer Header: Validate that requests come from expected origins by checking the Referer or Origin headers.\n",
    "4. Require User Interaction: For sensitive actions, require additional user interaction (e.g., re-entering a password) to ensure the user’s intention.\n",
